The idea for this project is to deconstruct Google's homepage and then recreate it myself. It's OK if the links (like searching or links to gmail or apps) don't work, but the idea is to get a feel for the design and how it works. 

What I learned:
* how to start a project
* how to structure an HTML doc 
* how to keep tinkering and how to give up on perfection even when it's oh-so close
* box-shadow, grids, coloring
